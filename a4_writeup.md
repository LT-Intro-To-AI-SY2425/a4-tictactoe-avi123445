# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
   
I feel like this assignemnt was a lot harder then the previous assignment. I am still getting used to python as I am used to coding in a different language, so some of the syntax was difficult for me.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

I would add a computer player to the game by having it iterate through thr board list, and if there is an open spot randomly put an x or an o.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

I would have the computer iterate through every possible move on the board, and from there determine which of those moves would put itself in the best position to get 3 in a row or stop the opponent from getting 3 in a row.
